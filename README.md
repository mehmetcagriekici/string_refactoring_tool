This is the V0 version, script use only.
I've built this script to refactor my tailwind code, v0 version is enough for me to continue my current project, but I will keep improving this code and turn this into a tool.
!!! Initial upload, does not work as intended after the removing sorting feature. The script supposed the return new strings from the original scripts which no longer have the common part. !!!
--SOLVED, Nothing to do with sorting, just a simple mistake, in org.ts.
